The directory `gambar/` is intended to contain image files, and since you mentioned that the image files are omitted, I will provide the contents of the `gambar/` directory as a comment indicating that it is intentionally left blank.

Here are the contents for the file:

/yuta-portfolio/yuta-portfolio/gambar/

<!-- This directory is intentionally left blank to hold image files used throughout the project. -->
